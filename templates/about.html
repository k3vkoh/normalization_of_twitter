		<h1>Twitter Normalizer</h1>
		<p>On X (previously known as Twitter), many people use shorthand notation or acronyms that normal normalizing and lemmatizing libraries cannot handle. These linguistic shortcuts create significant accessibility barriers for blind and low-vision individuals who rely on screen readers, as these tools struggle to interpret the nuances of such text. To address this issue, our project develops a dual-pipeline tool designed to enhance the readability of tweets and similar colloquial language for visually impaired users. The first pipeline utilizes Conditional Random Fields (CRF) to identify words that are amenable to normalization, followed by heuristic techniques to normalize the input sentences. The second pipeline applies heuristics directly to normalize each word individually. Both pipelines were evaluated for their effectiveness, showing comparable and promising results with a mean normalized error rate of 0.4286 for the CRF pipeline and 0.4302 for the non-CRF pipeline. These rates are slightly better than the baseline error rate of 0.4318 observed in our dataset. By comparing these approaches, our research not only highlights the potential for improving text accessibility on social media platforms but also contributes to the broader discourse on digital inclusivity for the visually impaired community.</p>
